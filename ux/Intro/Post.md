## Intro

The UX journey milestones of the project will consist of (as of now):
 1. Competitive Analysis
 2. Personas
 3. User stories
 4. User flows
 5. Red routes
 6. Brainstorm
 7. Wireframe
 8. Prototyping
 9. User tests
 10. IA
 11. Design guidelines
 12. Layout
 13. Typography

Step 8 and 9 will be iterated until as deemed fit, and the list may change as the project progresses.

The list is heavily inspired by the open-sourced [UX Checklist](https://uxchecklist.github.io/).

### Next: Competitive analysis

For the next part of the journey we're going to take a look at the available applications out there that has a similiar function as our (eventual) app. The purpose of the competitive analysis, and why we're doing it so soon in the process, is to find the competitions solution to the problem we're about to solve. Hopefully through the analysis we'll come up with a lot of great ideas as we look for the strengths, benefits, pitfalls and tradeoffs of our competitors and their applications. 

Before starting the analysis I'm going to be collecting resources and read up on how to make it as effective as possible, so that we can reap as much as possible from our investigation.
